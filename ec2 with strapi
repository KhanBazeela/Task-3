Step 1: EC2 Instance Provisioning using Terraform

Terraform configuration files were created to define AWS infrastructure.
An EC2 instance was provisioned using Terraform with the required instance type, AMI, security group, and key pair configuration.
A .pem key file was generated with the terragorm to enable secure SSH access to the EC2 instance.
Terraform was executed using terraform init and terraform apply to create the infrastructure.

Step 2: Secure SSH Access to EC2 Instance
After successful instance creation, the EC2 public IP address was obtained from AWS Console.
The EC2 instance was accessed securely from the local system using SSH and the generated .pem key file.

Step 3: Installation of Node.js and Required Dependencies
The EC2 instance was updated to ensure all system packages were up to date.
Node.js (compatible with Strapi requirements) and npm were installed.
Additional build and system dependencies required by Strapi were installed to support native module compilation.

Step 4: Strapi Application Installation
A new Strapi project was created using the Strapi CLI.
Required project dependencies were installed using npm.
Swap memory was configured on the EC2 instance to avoid memory-related installation issues.

Step 5: Running and Accessing the Strapi Application
The Strapi application was started on the default port (1337).
Necessary inbound rules were configured in the EC2 security group to allow access to port 1337.
The application was accessed using the EC2 public IP address via a web browser.
